## Notice
Transparent instancing objects could easily break instancing because other transparent objects cause blocking during rendering.I Suggest to use opaque or alphatest for instancing objects and srp bacher for transparent obejct.Also you can use DrawMeshInstancedor batch render group to impove perfomance.
